Today is the Mid-Autumn Festival, a celebration of the moon. After my date with Ms. Hu, I found myself with nothing to do. My mind was filled with clutter as I lay in bed. I realized I should take some action.

After much consideration, I made a small but potentially significant decision, that is, I have decided to start writing a diary in English to document my life. More specifically, I aim to improve my English in the process of recording so that I can communicate with more people around the world and exchange insights about the meaning of life in the future. 

Why do I use electronic documents for this? The most important reason is that e-documents are easy to retrieve, store, and search for words at any time while writing. :-).

For a long time, I believed that my greatest flaw was my inability to commit to one thing for an extended period. I hope I can remain dedicated to this diary. Wish me the best.
