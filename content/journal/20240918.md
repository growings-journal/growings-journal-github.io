It’s very hot today, it feels like returning to midsummer. When I woke up this morning and arrived at the office, The sirens reminded me that today is September 18th. A date all Chinese people should remember. I am no exception.

Honestly, I have never forgotten this significant date, I still remember the atrocities committed by the Japanese invaders in China in 1931. However I am reluctant to witness many of the events occurring today. For instance, on WeChat Moments, some individuals insist that everyone must remember this day, and you’d better repost messages commemorating it, otherwise you may be disloyal to the country, or have some tendency about disloyal. Another instance is that some streamers have been cautioned by fans against broadcast live today, despite the absence of any law prohibiting entertainment activities on this date. I disapprove of these behaviors that attack others in the name of patriotism. I hope tomorrow will be better.
