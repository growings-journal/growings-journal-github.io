With the feeling of drunkenness, I wrote today’s diary. There are only one important things in these two days, is the Chinese stock market is performing exceptionally well, and I made some quick money. 

I purchased the ETF50 when the Shanghai Composite Index was around 2,750 points last week, believing it would be the bottom. The ETF50 surged rapidly yesterday, allowing me to earn CNY 4,000 easily and quickly. I shared my excitement with my colleagues while walking after work, but I chose not to mention it to Ms. Hu. It’s not that I want to hide anything; rather, I’m aware that she has just graduated and her salary is not particularly high. I don’t want to undermine her self-confidence by flaunting my quick earnings, even though she is the best in my mind. I plan to use the money to buy her the bracelet that she wants.

Oh, I hope the Shanghai Composite Index continues to rise a few more days.
