It’s a real day off.I spent few hours reading a book I bought a few days ago, titled “The Road to Serfdom”, but I haven’t finished it yet. I will share my thoughts after I finish reading it in a few days. In my spare time, I cooked two meals for myself.

Last week, I discovered that my phone periodically report my app list to the manufacturer’s server. This could be a way for the government to monitor our activities. They may not want us to install certain software that can communicate freely. To circumvent this issue,  I installed the international version of Hyper OS .

In addition, an important thing happened recently, A Japanese child was killed in Shenzhen, Guangdong province on September 18th, The criminal is a fervent nationalist from China. I deeply regret the loss of this child, and I am increasingly concerned about the rising tide of nationalist propaganda in recent years. I hope that we don’t witness the emergency of another Boxer Rebellion.
