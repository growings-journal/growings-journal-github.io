I haven't written in my journal for a while. I recently had a busy and idle National Day holiday.

In China, the National Day holiday lasts for seven days, during the first four days, I went home to spend the holiday with my father. He always works hard for his children's future, but it's also hard to communicate with him, He is a contradictory man. On October 3, he and I went hiking to Nangong Mountain, in Langao county, Shaanxi Province. The weather was excellent that day, and we had a lot of fun.

I returned to Xi'an on the evening of the 4th. After a brief rest of one day, I went out with Ms. Hu to travel to Yuanjia Village and the Outlets Mall. I was deeply touched that Ms. Hu insisted on purchasing shoes with her own money instead of allowing me pay. What a wonderful woman!
